Using the existing blog hero generator, modified to use circular arcs (instead of rounded rectangles), and uses masks to add a border to the tracks with a higher z-index. The controls provide the ability to modify colours and provide alternative seeds.

Exploring the use of procedural Vector Fields, with random particule distribution. Inspired by [Earth Nullschool](https://earth.nullschool.net/). Will also take more inspiration from [Particles in Simplex Noise Field](https://codepen.io/DonKarlssonSan/post/particles-in-simplex-noise-flow-field)
